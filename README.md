⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the very first computer bug was literally an insect? In 1947, Grace Hopper found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. It goes to show that even the smallest issues can have significant consequences. Always eager to learn more in computer science and achieve my goals! 😄🚀
